=head1 NAME

UserAgent::Any::JSON â€“ Specialization of UserAgent::Any for JSON APIs.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $json_client = UserAgent::Any::JSON::New->new(LWP::UserAgent->new(%options));

  my $res_data = $json_client->get($url, \%url_params, \%req_data, \%headers);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<UserAgent::Any::JSON> is a generic client (user agent) for JSON based API,
built on top of L<UserAgent::Any>. As such, it supports synchronous and
asynchronous calls and can use many different user agent libraries.

See L<the UserAgent::Any documentation|UserAgent::Any/Supported user agents> for
the list of supported user agents, their semantics, and limitations.

=head2 Constructor

  my $json_client = UserAgent::Any::JSON->new($underlying_ua);

Builds a new C<UserAgent::Any::JSON> object wrapping the given underlying user
agent.
The wrapped object must be an instance of a
L<supported user agent|UserAgent::Any/Supported user agents>.

=head2 User agent methods

=head3 get, head, delete

  my $res_data = $json_client->get($url, %headers);

  $json_client->get_cb($url, %headers)->($cb);

  my $promise = $json_client->get_p($url, %headers);

Execute a C<GET> HTTP request to the given url. The arguments are exactly the
same as for the equivalent
L<method in UserAgent::Any|UserAgent::Any/get>. The only difference is that the
response is returned as a L<UserAgent::Any::JSON::Response> object (either
directly in the synchronous method or passed to the callback or the promise in
the asynchronous methods).

The C<head> and C<delete> methods have the exact same behavior, but using the
C<HEAD> and C<DELETE> HTTP verbs.

See the documentation of L<get() in UserAgent::Any|UserAgent::Any/get> for the
details on the asynchronous behavior of the callback and promise versions of
this method (and of all the other methods of this class).

=head3 post, patch, put

  my $res_data = $json_client->post($url, %headers, \%body);

  $json_client->post_cb($url, %headers, \%body)->($cb);

  my $promise = $json_client->post_p($url, %headers, \%body);

This is similar to the C<get> method but using the C<POST>, C<PATCH>, and C<PUT>
HTTP verbs. In addition, like the similar
L<methods in UserAgent::Any|UserAgent::Any/post> they take a last parameter for
the request body. Here, this parameter should be a reference to a Perl
data-structure that will be JSON encoded with the
L<C<JSON::to_json>|JSON/to_json> function.
